  # Installation
  Using Node.js and the Inquirer Package, this application allows users to quickly develop a README. md file using command-line controls in their terminal. To install, run the following processes first in your terminal: 'npm init -y', then 'npm i inquirer', then make sure to add a '.gitignore' file. Once the user has all required files downloaded, type 'node index.js', and the prompts requiring user input will begin. Once finished, a README.md will be generated.
